# Module-19-CryptoClustering
files for Data Boot Camp Module 19 CryptoClustering Challege

## Challenege Overview 

In this challenge I used Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes by doing the following: 

1. Finding the best value for k using the original scaled DataFrame

2. Clustering cryptocurrencies with K-Means using original scaled data 

3. Optimizing clusters with Principle Component Analysis (PCA)

4. Finding the best value for k using the PCA data and clustering the cryptocurrencies with K-Means using the PCA data 

5. Creating composite plots to contrast the outcome with and without using the optimization techniques.
